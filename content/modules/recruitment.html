        <p>This module helps make the recruitment process much easier. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Following input of the details of a new vacancy (e.g. Job Title, application deadline, interview date, proposed weekly hours and pay rate, etc.), the details of each applicant and his/her referees are recorded. The module will then generate editable pro forma letters for invitation to interview, reference requests, immediate and post interview rejections, job offer etc.; similarly, standard interview formats can be edited for specific use, allowing a schedule to be printed that ensures consistency of evaluation.</p>
        <p>As part of the recruitment process, the system provides numerous Person Specifications, Job Descriptions and Reference Requests. These can be edited as required and then selected for use with each vacancy.</p>
        <p>Having selected the preferred candidate and specified the Offer Details, the Job Offer letter can be generated, and once he/she has accepted the position, all the relevant information about the candidate and the vacancy are automatically transferred to the Personnel Module.</p>
