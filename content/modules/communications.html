        <p>All the basic contact information for every individual or department known to the Practice is held here.</p>
        <p>Staff – Partners – Locums - Commercial suppliers - HA/CSU Officers - Pharmaceutical companies - Hospitals and other healthcare providers - Local and National authority offices (e.g. HMRC, NHS Pensions Agency, etc.) - Professional bodies.</p>
        <p>By using the powerful search and merge facilities, letters, faxes and memos – with the Practice's header-sheet details and/or logo if applicable – can be instantly produced, saved and retrieved as required. Searchable contact logs for each individual/department are maintained showing the summary details of all these documents. These logs can also include details of telephone calls and face-to-face meetings, so they become a complete record of orders placed, faults logged, promises made, queries raised etc.. Each item within the contact log can be given a security level, so that it can only be opened by a user with the appropriate access permissions.</p>
