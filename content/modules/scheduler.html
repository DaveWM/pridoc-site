        <p>The Scheduler provides a single, easy-to-use graphical ‘planner' that can, subject to access permissions, be viewed and edited across the Practice network. Being fully integrated with PriDoc’s Personnel and Payroll modules, the Scheduler is a unique – and exceptionally powerful – tool which provides a fantastic combination of features and benefits:<br><br>• graphical daily 'attendance' views of staff and Partners’ normal shift/session patterns are provided<br><br>• details of any overtime, or any absence (e.g. holiday, time-off-in-lieu, sickness, maternity/paternity/adoption, training/sabbatical, unauthorised, etc.) are added directly onto the daily 'attendance' views - which then provide the 'complete picture' of the day - so for example overtime can be seen alongside any absence that may have caused the overtime to be required <br><br>• shift/session patterns can repeat over any number of weeks <br><br>• <strong>employees with more than one job</strong> can have separate shift patterns that will be validated against each other (so they are never scheduled to be in two places at once or the same place twice!)<br><br>• <strong>GP and Nurse Locum sessions</strong> can also be added directly onto the daily 'attendance' views, and these can be assigned to specific, named locums <br><br>• individual shifts/overtime/sessions can have an <strong>assigned 'hourly rate multiplier'</strong> (e.g. double time on Saturdays), and/or an <strong>assigned budget</strong>, and/or an <strong>assigned Workplace</strong> (for multi-Site Practices), and/or an assigned Practice (for multi-Practice employers)<br><br>• <strong>Holiday entitlement balances</strong> are automatically monitored (and following changes to an employee’s weekly hours, the system will automatically re-calculate (pro rata) his/her annual holiday entitlement)</p>
        <p>• <strong>TOIL (time-off-in-lieu) balances</strong> are automatically monitored <br><br>• graphical daily, monthly and yearly views can all be filtered for <strong>user-defined groups of staff</strong> and/or Partners and/or Locums<br><br>• comprehensive 'totals' analysis for normal work, overtime, and each type of absence, for any given data range, in terms of hours or sessions, is automatically provided</p>
