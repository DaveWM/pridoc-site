        <p>Key functions here are compliance with employment law and the provision of comprehensive, up-to-date personnel information. Current and historical information on all aspects of employees' jobs is organised in a way that ensures the user can easily (subject to appropriate password protection) maintain and access secure, up-to-date personnel records.</p>
        <p>As in the ‘real world’, new employees can be added to the PriDoc system from a Vacancy, which is managed from within the Recruitment module. If you wish to bypass the ‘Recruitment’ module, new employees can also be added directly to the ‘Personnel’ module.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For new employees, the user enters the <strong>Job details</strong> (e.g. shift pattern, sick pay plan, and default Practice and/or site where applicable), following which the appropriate <strong>Contract of Employment</strong> can be selected from the library of editable pro forma contracts (including BMA-approved editions for Registrars, Retainees, Assistants and Associates): the selected Contract will automatically include all the relevant details that have been already entered onto the System.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <strong>Job Induction form</strong>, based on all the items in the selected Job Description, can also easily be generated.</p>
        <p>Other ‘personnel events' are also facilitated: information is recorded about <strong>appraisals</strong>, in-house/external <strong>training</strong> and any <strong>disciplinary &amp; grievance events </strong>so that appropriate forms, letters and reports can easily be produced and maintained.</p>
