        <p>As Payroll is fully integrated with the Personnel and Scheduler Modules, all staff pay details and overtime, sickness and other relevant information is already known to the System, so processing the monthly payroll becomes delightfully simple. The user has the facility to edit or add to the payroll information that has been supplied from the Personnel and Scheduler Modules and then the payroll is confirmed.</p>
        <p>In addition to all the basic payroll functions, other facilities include:</p>
        <p>• Electronic NHS Pension Scheme returns for joiners, leavers and end-of-year updates</p>
        <p>• Validation of employee NHS Pension Scheme contribution rates against their WTE pay</p>
        <p>• Application of the Practice policy, or BMA policy as appropriate, in the calculation of paid sick leave and paid maternity leave</p>
        <p>• Generation of NHS Pension Scheme monthly statements LP11 and LP11-GP</p>
        <p>• Electronic submissions to HMRC to satisfy the mandatory online filing of PAYE documents</p>
        <p>• Automatic recording of deemed pay and disallowed days for members of the NHS Pension Scheme</p>
        <p>For Practices already using “PayeDoc – the specialist GP Payroll service”, an interface is provided so that payroll information, fully encrypted for security, can easily be passed from PriDoc’s Personnel and Scheduler</p>
