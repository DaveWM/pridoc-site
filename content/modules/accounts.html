        <p><strong>Recording of all items of income and expenditure</strong><br>The Accounts module has been designed to make all adding/editing and viewing of 'transactions' possible from a single datasheet screen. The datasheet can easily be 'filtered', for example to show a specific date range or a selelcted transaction type (e.g. cheque). All transactions are assigned a category and the list of category codes from which to choose is the list drawn up by AISMA. Expenditure items can be categorised automatically by reference to the Payee (so for example an expenditure item for GSK will have a default category of “Drugs and Medical Expenses”). <br><br><strong>Other Methods of Data Entry</strong><br>Every pay period, transactions can be electronically imported directly from PriDoc's Payroll module or from the specialist GP Payroll bureau "PayeDoc". You can also electronically import the statements that you have downloaded from the Open Exeter system so that the Gross Payments and the Variance Details can quickly and accurately be available for the Accounts module's reports and analyses. <br><br><strong>Generation of a fully analysed Income and Expenditure Schedule for any given date range</strong><br>The normal GMS/PMS/APMS Income and Expenditure headings and categories are provided as standard, and these can be further sub-divided or otherwise amended to accommodate the requirements of the Practice and/or its accountants.<br><br><strong>Tracking of Practice Budgets</strong><br>All items can be attributed to one or more user-defined budgets (e.g. Prescribing Incentive Scheme funding, Medical Research Council award, notional Staff Budget, etc.), thus making light work of budget management.<br><br><strong>Cash-flow forecasting</strong><br>Transactions can be designated as Projected transactions: these will not be actual transactions, but will be used for cash-flow forecasting. The entry of Projected income and expenditure items can be largely automated by reference to entries in corresponding prior periods. Cash-flow and Income and Expenditure Schedules can then be produced based on Actual income and expenditure up to the current date and Projected income and expenditure after the current date. In this way, end-of-month/quarter/year forecasting is easy to manage and always up-to-date.</p>
