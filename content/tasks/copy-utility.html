              <div class="yjsquare_in">
                <p>Having backed up your <strong>PriDoc</strong> database (see <a href="{{g.url('/content/tasks/backup-utility.html').path}}" title="Download Database Backup Utility">Database Backup Utility</a>), it is important that the <strong>PriDoc</strong> files and folders on
                  the <em>PriDoc Server</em> (i.e. the machine on which the <strong>PriDoc</strong> database resides) are <strong>copied to a secure storage location</strong>. One of the best approaches for your organisation would be to create a scheduled
                  task that creates the copies automatically at pre-allotted times. The task could be regularly scheduled (at least once per day) for specified times when the <em>PriDoc Server</em> is known to be powered on. With this in mind, we have
                  especially produced a utility called <strong>"Security Copy"</strong> that you are free to download below that creates copies of the <strong>PriDoc</strong> files and folders in a user-specified target directory. For example, this target
                  directory could be on a network drive that is regularly backed up to tapes which are then stored off-site or the target could be located on a separate PC (i.e. not the <em>PriDoc Server</em>). Using either of these locations for creating
                  your security copies ensures that in the event of a failure affecting the <em>PriDoc Server</em>, your backup data is safely preserved elsewhere and can be used to restore your system to how it was when the latest security copy was created.</p>
                <p>A configuration tool named <strong>“Setup Configuration File”</strong> is also supplied in the download so that the target directory for the copies can be easily specified.</p>
                <p>An audit trail of each security copy is written to the folder "Database Backup Logs" in the ‘Emani Software' folder in the ‘Program Files' directory.</p>
                <p>We hope you find this utility to be of value. As always, do please get in touch (via the contact methods given below) if you require any further information.</p>
