                                        <p><strong>Your Practice will already have various administrative systems in place, but these systems may be quite independent of each other and thus involve significant duplication of effort - bringing the risk of inconsistencies between systems as well as making the tasks involved far more time-consuming. With PriDoc, there is no duplication whatsoever, and the need for transferring information between systems is avoided. This brings many advantages in terms of time-saving and accuracy.&nbsp;</strong></p>
                                        <h3>PriDoc's modules are fully 'integrated' so all information is entered only once. There is no need to transfer information between different systems (e.g. spreadsheets, timesheets, personnel records, payroll software etc.) – PriDoc keeps everything consistent and accurate.</h3>

                                        <div id="reason-0-extra">
                                            <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
                                            <p>The best example of this is in relation to rotas, overtime, holidays/sickness etc., and pay. Many Practices will have one or more 'year planners' on the wall, or diaries, for managing this information – often in combination with timesheets, holiday forms etc.. Other Practices will use spreadsheets, and/or specific computer programs - e.g. one of a number of commercial Payroll or Rota packages. The Scheduler module within PriDoc, being fully integrated with the system’s Personnel and Payroll modules, is a unique – and exceptionally powerful – tool which provides a fantastic combination of features and benefits:<br><br>• a single, electronic data source is maintained that can, subject to access permissions,&nbsp;be viewed and edited across the Practice network <br><br>• graphical daily 'attendance' views of staff and Partners’ normal shift/session patterns are provided<br><br>• shift/session patterns can repeat over any number of weeks <br><br>• <strong>employees with more than one job</strong> can have separate shift patterns that will be validated against each other (so they are never scheduled to be in two places at once or the same place twice!) <br><br>• details of any overtime, or any absence (e.g. holiday, sickness, maternity/paternity/adoption, training/sabbatical, unauthorised, etc.) are added directly onto the daily 'attendance' views - which then provide the 'complete picture' of the day - so for example overtime can be seen alongside any absence that may have caused the overtime to be required <br><br>• <strong>GP and Nurse Locum sessions</strong> can also be added directly onto the daily 'attendance' views, and these can be assigned to specific, named locums&nbsp;<br><br>• individual shifts/overtime/sessions can have an <strong>assigned 'hourly rate multiplier'</strong> (e.g. double time on Saturdays),&nbsp;and/or an <strong>assigned budget</strong>, and/or an <strong>assigned Workplace</strong> (for multi-Site Practices), and/or an assigned Practice (for multi-Practice employers)<br><br>• <strong>Holiday entitlement balances</strong> are automatically monitored (and following changes to an employee’s weekly hours, the system will automatically re-calculate (pro rata) his/her annual holiday entitlement) <br><br>• <strong>TOIL (time-off-in-lieu) balances</strong> are automatically monitored<br><br>• graphical <strong>daily, monthly and yearly views</strong> can all be filtered for <strong>user-defined groups of staff</strong> and/or Partners and/or Locums<br><br>• comprehensive 'totals' analysis for normal work, overtime, and each&nbsp;type of absence, for any given data range, in terms of hours or sessions, is automatically provided<br><br>• following changes to an employee’s weekly hours, the system will automatically re-calculate (pro rata) his/her annual holiday entitlement<br><br>• integration with Payroll: the Payroll Reports will provide all the required information for input to the Practice's Payroll system/provider. As well as basic pay, overtime hours etc., where any sickness/maternity etc. absence has been entered this will include calculations of SSP, SMP etc., and also Practice sick/maternity pay according to the employee's sickness/maternity entitlements as defined in his/her record in the Personnel module (e.g. 2 months' full pay followed by 2 months' half pay). The <strong>integration of PriDoc's own Payroll module</strong> provides further, massive time savings as well as a seamless interface.</p>
                                            <h3><br>PriDoc will dramatically reduce the time spent on these – and numerous other – administrative processes, while at the same time providing the Practice Manager with a quality of management information that really is exceptional.</h3>

                                            <p>For example, the <strong>Daily Planner</strong> in the Scheduler module provides a graphical view that displays holiday, sickness and parental absence alongside staff regular shifts and overtime. By ‘drilling down' on certain sections of the view any relevant further parameters can be viewed and amended.</p>
                                            <p>The Scheduler module also provides comprehensive reports on staff<strong> 'Holiday Entitlements'</strong> (that show holidays taken or booked and the balance remaining) and on staff<strong> 'Time-off-in-lieu'</strong> (that show overtime rewarded as TOIL, TOIL taken and the balance remaining). &nbsp;</p>
                                            <p>Similarly, when processing the monthly Payroll (that will have been automatically populated from the entries in the Scheduler), the user is presented with a very wide range of detailed reports that provide an<strong> analysis of the monthly pay</strong>.</p>
                                            <p>There is also a significant amount of text-based information that a Practice needs to access. The <strong>Communications module</strong> can be used to record orders placed, promises made, faults logged etc., and copies of all correspondence can be maintained. Furthermore a Partner – or any staff member with appropriate access rights – asking a question like: “What is our Grievance Procedure?” or “What does our I.T. Security Policy say about installing software?” will be able to get at this information directly.&nbsp;</p>

                                            <p>Where two or more Practices are working together, each Practice can be set up independently with its own Partners, Staff, etc.. Staff and other costs can then be allocated in any desired proportions between the Practices.</p>

PriDoc allows you to enter the separate job details for any employee, each with his/her own job description, pay rate, shift pattern etc.. The system will check that the two (or more!) shift patterns never conflict, and it will combine the two (or more!) holiday allowances etc..</p>

The same view is then used to enter overtime, and any further absences, so you can see all the relevant information together.<br> <br>2. The same view is also used to <strong>enter ‘time-off-in-lieu' (TOIL) hours</strong> – both worked and ‘taken back’, so that each employee’s <strong>TOIL balance can easily be monitored</strong>.</p>
