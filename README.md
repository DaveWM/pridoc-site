# pridoc-site

The site is built with [grow](http://grow.io/) (installation instructions [here](http://grow.io/start/1/)). It's only designed to work on linux and mac, I'm not sure if it'll run in the windows bash shell.

All documentation for grow can be found [here](http://grow.io/docs/).

To build the site, run `grow build`. This will create a static site in the `/build` directory. You can then host these files anywhere, as long as you keep the directory structure the same.
